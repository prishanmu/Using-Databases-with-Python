# Using-Databases-with-Python
Assignments and associated files from University of Michigan's Python for Everybody course: Using Databases with Python. I have already learned these topics as a part of my degree in data science, however, I wanted to take a refresher course on these concepts to prepare myself for my new position. 

Within the course we are learning the following: 
* CRUD databases and tables using both SQL queries and Python programs
* Data Models and Relational SQL, including using and maintaining multi-table databases
* Many-to-many relationships in SQL
* Data visualization using databases
